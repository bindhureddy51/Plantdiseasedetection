The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras. It employs a CNN architecture with multiple convolutional layers followed by pooling layers to capture the essential features of plant leaf images. It then uses a fully connected layer for classification into different disease categories.
The dataset used for training consists of images of plant leaves labeled with various diseases or marked as healthy. It includes:
1.Rust Disease
2.Powdery Mildew Disease
3.Healthy Plants
